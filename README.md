A.	List the symbols that for each of the below Javascript operators
    1.	Arithmetic Operators (+ addition sign, - subtraction sign, x multiplication sign,  ÷division sign, ** exponentiation, % modulo, ++ increment, -- decrement)
    2.	Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=)
    3.	Comparison Operators (>, <, >=. <=, !=, !==, ==, ===)
    4.	Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
    5.	Bitwise Operators (|, ~, ^, <)

B.	For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples
    Arithmetic Operators: (20 + 5 =25) console.log(sum);, (20 - 5 =15) console.log(difference);
    Assignment Operators: console.log(a += 5) console.log( a *= 5)
    Comparison Operators: console.log(cash === expenses) console.log(cash !== expenses)
    Logical Operators: (a ==20 || b==15) (a <20 && b> 15)
    Bitwise Operators: (10^5) (5<<10)


D. What is the result when the following program is executed?
For (let i= 1;  1 < 20; I += 7) {
       Console.log(i);
}	
    Answer:  1, 8, 15 

E. Write a program that takes a positive number (num) and finds the power of 2 nearest to that number. The program stores the resulting value to pwr. Then you log the answer in this format: 
“The number (pwr) is the power of 2 nearest to (num).”

Answer: If num = 100, pwr =128
“The number 128 is the power of 2 nearest to 100.”
